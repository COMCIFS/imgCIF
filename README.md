# imgCIF
This repository is for the development of the IUCr imgCIF dictionary. The imgCIF dictionary provides 
data names for description of raw image data, usually from diffraction experiments.  The dictionary in this 
repository is a **draft** and data names and meanings are subject to change. **Do not** rely on the 
dictionary in this repository when preparing software.
