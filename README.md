# imgCIF
This repository is for the development of the IUCr DDLm imgCIF dictionary. The imgCIF dictionary provides 
data names for description of raw image data, usually from diffraction experiments.  The dictionaries in this 
repository are **drafts** and data names and meanings are subject to change. **Do not** rely on the 
dictionary in this repository when preparing software.

Note that the DDL2 and DDLm versions of the dictionary will differ slightly in the behaviour of categories and how they 
integrate with other dictionaries. One goal of this development is to completely remove any discrepancies in
DDL2/DDLm behaviour.
