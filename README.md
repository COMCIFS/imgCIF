# imgCIF
The imgCIF dictionary provides 
data names for description of raw image data, usually from diffraction experiments.  The dictionaries in this 
repository are **drafts** and data names and meanings are subject to change. **Do not** rely on the 
dictionary in this repository when preparing software. Currently the main development of imgCIF takes place
in the [cbflib repository](https://github.com/yayahjb/cbflib/tree/master/doc).
